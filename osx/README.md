my old ideas

 - eneimies can make thinks mobile
 - build your own pizza ria simulation

- door logic
- each door has a light
- find stuff to get the door unlocked

- make it so everything is darker until the lights are turned on

enemies:
- Benny is the only one where your fear gauge goes up as you get near him

first night
Goal: get generator running
- in one room there noose and a body, thats where you get the rope, and the keycard, to unlock the security room. The old security guard.
- low dark ominous music that changes to high when the fear kicks in.
- 12 - 1 (20 minutes)

- at 3 animatronics follow certain paths. (mark the map for the path, with arrows) 
- room next to the kitchen is the kids room, with two shelves, 
- music box you need to crank to keep the giraffe in the box
- if the giaraffe gets out he comes right after you. 
- music box makes jungle sounds safari desert sounds - loud nature noises, with rainfall
- takes 20 seconds
- you can hide in the security room
- close the doors to escape
- after a while you can go back to the music box and the giraffe goes back
- wack an animatronic - minigame, star is on the head of the animatronic, Xs are on top of the heads, use the mouse. 
- you have to try not to get killed

- duct tape - install the cameras (in the kitchen)
- find the cameras (storage with the generator)
- install the cameras

third night
- text message "There are good animatronic spirits there to help you, but you've got to find them!"
- find the vent that goes to the secret place but it's too small to fit through
- but someone on the other side is giving you other things (good spirit animatronix)

Okay so the pathfinding would be really cool!
However, I don't want have to start over from the beginning every single time.
I guess for now, I could hack it.
Set monster to pathfinding mode, make everyone go random.

- [x] pathfinding
- [x] time goes hour to hour
- [x] stop showing the time 
- [x] pops up on the hour, doesn't show minutes
- [x] 15 minutes for an hour
- [x] fear mode
- [x] create a fear meter
- [x] only 3 animatronics kill you, the rest just bring your fear gauge up
    - ones that kill you: Dark figures, giraffe, Benny
